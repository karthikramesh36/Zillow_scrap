# Zillow_scrap

An automated Desktop app that allows Users to scrap data from heavy loaded Zillow.com with respect to input for data analytics
Selenium with python used to validate, automate and navigate pages and a HTML parser used to extract data from site
Alternative use of selenium implemented and extracted data stored in Pandas dataframe.

The project structure is not upto enterprise standards as it was my exploration through python. Check out the repo with same name to get an idea of the a generalized project template for selenium under java
